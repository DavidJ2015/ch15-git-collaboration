# Exercise-4

In this exercise, you'll edit the same file with a partner and resolve
the merge conflicts that almost always will arise.  Your taks are

1. fork and clone this repository,
2. follow the instructions in `exercise.R` file,
3. then `add` and `commit` your changes so that you can `push` them
back up to Github.
4. finally, ensure that both of you end up with the same conflict-free
   version of the repo.

Learning how to successfully collaborate in a team to pull and merge
one another's changes will make your life a lot easier than juggling
different files. With this exercise you should practice using both
**branches** and **merges**. While you will be working in teams you
should avoid communicating your changes to the code in order to
stimulate a "real-world" scenario.

Note that there is no completed branch for this exercise.
