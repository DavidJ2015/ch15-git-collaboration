# Chapter 15: Git Collaboration

Exercises for [chapter 15](https://info201.github.io/git-collaboration.html).

1. Two people edit different files, pull before push, not conflict.
2. Two people edit the same file, get conflit, resolve it.
3. Individual, merge conflict through branches
4. Two people edit same code, fix merge conflicts

Note, there is no `complete` branch showing each step. Also, exercises
should be **re-written** to use `merge` rather than `rebase`.
